# adpcmtest

This is a simple framework for running the memory tests from https://github.com/hyano/opna-analyze

The tests in the `test` directory are written in python, but convert easily to C++.

The adpcm_tester class provides an object that looks similar to the one used in the tests, and generates compatible output.
